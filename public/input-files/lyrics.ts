[00:18.10]It starts with one thing
[00:19.80]
[00:20.00]I don't know why
[00:21.10]
[00:21.30]It doesn't even matter how hard you try
[00:23.40]
[00:23.60]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
[00:25.60]
[00:25.80]To explain in due time
[00:27.00]
[00:27.20]All I know
[00:28.60]
[00:28.80]Time is a valuable thing
[00:30.40]
[00:30.60]Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
[00:32.50]
[00:32.70]Watch it count down to the end of the day
[00:34.60]
[00:34.80]The clock ticks life away
[00:36.00]
[00:36.20]It's so unreal
[00:37.80]
[00:38.00]Didn't look out below
[00:39.40]
[00:39.60]Watch the time go right out the window
[00:41.80]
[00:42.00]Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
[00:43.90]
[00:44.10]I wasted it all just to watch you go
[00:46.30]
[00:46.50]I kept everything inside
[00:48.40]
[00:48.60]And even though I tried, it all fell apart
[00:50.70]
[00:50.90]What it meant to me
[00:52.00]
[00:52.20]Will eventually be a memory of a time when
[00:55.70]
[00:55.90]I tried so hard
[00:56.80]And got so far
[00:59.40]
[00:59.60]But in the end
[01:01.10]
[01:01.30]It doesn't even matter
[01:03.40]
[01:03.60]I had to fall
[01:05.50]
[01:05.70]To lose it all
[01:08.30]
[01:08.50]But in the end
[01:10.20]
[01:10.40]It doesn't even matter
[01:14.10]
[01:14.30]One thing, I don't know why
[01:16.00]
[01:16.20]It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
[01:18.20]
[01:18.40]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
[01:20.30]
[01:20.50]To remind myself of a time when
[01:21.60]I tried so hard
[01:23.50]
[01:23.70]In spite of the way you were mocking me
[01:25.30]
[01:25.50]Acting like I was part of your property
[01:27.60]
[01:27.80]Remembering all the times you fought with me
[01:29.90]
[01:30.10]I'm surprised it got so
[01:32.10]
[01:32.30]Things aren't the way they were before
[01:34.50]
[01:34.70]You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
[01:36.80]
[01:37.00]Not that you knew me back then
[01:38.60]
[01:38.80]But it all comes back to me in the end
[01:42.00]
[01:42.20]I kept everything inside
[01:43.30]
[01:43.50]And even though I tried, it all fell apart
[01:45.70]
[01:45.90]What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
[01:49.30]
[01:49.50]I tried so hard
[01:51.20]
[01:51.40]And got so far
[01:54.10]
[01:54.30]But in the end
[01:55.70]
[01:55.90]It doesn't even matter
[01:58.20]
[01:58.40]I had to fall
[02:00.20]
[02:00.40]To lose it all
[02:03.10]
[02:03.30]But in the end
[02:04.90]
[02:05.10]It doesn't even matter
[02:09.80]
[02:10.00]I've put my trust in you
[02:14.70]
[02:14.90]Pushed as far as I can go
[02:19.20]
[02:19.40]For all this
[02:21.30]
[02:21.50]There's only one thing you should know
[02:28.00]
[02:28.20]I've put my trust in you
[02:32.60]
[02:32.80]Pushed as far as I can go
[02:37.00]
[02:37.20]For all this
[02:39.20]
[02:39.40]There's only one thing you should know
[02:46.00]
[02:46.20]I tried so hard
[02:48.30]
[02:48.50]And got so far
[02:51.30]
[02:51.50]But in the end
[02:52.90]
[02:53.10]It doesn't even matter
[02:55.30]
[02:55.50]I had to fall
[02:57.40]
[02:57.60]To lose it all
[03:00.30]
[03:00.50]But in the end
[03:02.10]
[03:02.30]It doesn't even matter
[03:07.30]
